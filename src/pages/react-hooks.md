React hooks is a new feature that was available in React version 16.7 but now is stable
in 16.8 and can be used in production.  Hooks allow functional components to have the following

* State - hooks give functional components access to state

* Lifecycles - hooks give functional components lifecycle methods

In this tutorial you'll be able to learn how to use hooks in a practical way.  By building
real-world sample application from scratch you'll be able to understand the concept and learn
how to apply Hooks to your React app.
